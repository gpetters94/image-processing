# DCNN

Two implementations of DCNN to classify images. These ones in particular were designed to identify images as containing pedestrians or not.

# Files

dcnn.py - initial implementation of the DCNN.

dcnn_dropout.py - improved implementation which uses dropout to mitigate overfitting.

# Acknowledgements

The loader code is adapted from code written by Carlos Castillo.
